==========
A cheat/tool/bot/whatever for a browser flash game named DarkOrbit.
It does some pretty neat stuff and is still under heavy development.

How to install/use?
----------
### Firefox
1. Install the addon through about:debugging panel.
2. Use any web proxy to replace the main.swf and preloader.swf
3. Enjoy

### Chrome/Chromium
1. Coming soon!

### Issues
If the tool doesn't work, try to use Private mode/Incognito
Other situations should be reported in [issues](../../issues) (game updates are fine there too)
